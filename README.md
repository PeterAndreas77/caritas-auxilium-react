# Goal & Use Case

This is a simple humanitarian crisis donation logger app. Often times when people got news from social media about humanitarian crisis, they just shared the news and they forget about it. This app takes that extra step by bridging the crisis to people who want to help by donating their money.

# User Stories & Initial UX

1. Initial landing page explains what this app is for. Most of the instructions on how to use the app and other features will be on this page.

3. Main Page. Once users successfully register or login, they will be directed to the main page. Main page is populated with recent humanitarian crises from all over the world. Users can click on a crisis card to read more about the crisis and donate if they feel compelled.

4. In this Donation page, users can see their acts. If there are any mistakes when entering the form or the users have not donated yet, users can update or delete the acts in their collection. These crisis cards contain more information about the crisis when they are clicked, same as main page ones.
